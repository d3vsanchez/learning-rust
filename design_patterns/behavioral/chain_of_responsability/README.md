## Chain of responsability

The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a chain of handlers, each of which is responsible for handling a specific type of request or task. 

Instead of a single object processing the request directly, the pattern forms a chain of handler objects, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain.
